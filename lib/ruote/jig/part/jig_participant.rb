    #
    # Ruote 2.0 participant which does a HTTP call using rufus-jig
    # (http://rufus.rubyforge.org/rufus-jig/), a HTTP client, greedy with JSON
    # content.
    #
    # By default, it POSTs received workitems as JSON to a HTTP server and
    # stores the answer back into the workitem. If the answer is in JSON, it is
    # automatically converted into Ruby data types (this magic is thanks to
    # rufus-jig).
    #
    # The handling of outgoing and incoming data may be customized by Procs.
    #
    # == Using it
    #   require 'yajl' # by default, you will need some JSON lib (yajl-ruby or json_pure or ActiveSupport)
    #
    #   # require this lib
    #   require 'ruote/jig/part/jig_participant'
    #
    #   # let's assume you have a ruote engine in '''engine'''
    #   engine.register_participant :jig_default, Ruote::Jig::JigParticipant
    #   engine.register_participant :jig_advanced, Ruote::Jig::JigParticipant.new(
    #     :host              => 'somehost',
    #     :port              => 80,
    #     :path              => '/path/to/the/magic',
    #     :method            => :post,
    #     :content_type      => 'foo/bar',
    #     :data_preparition  => Proc.new {|workitem| workitem.fields['foo_bar'].to_s},

    #       workitem.set_field('incoming_foo_bar', FooBar.from_str(response.body))
    #     end
    #   )
    #
    #   # in a workflow definition...
    #   participant :ref => 'jig_default' # will POST the current workitem as JSON
    #                                     # to http://127.0.0.1:3000/ and save the
    #                                     # responded data in the workitem field
    #                                     # __jig_response__
    #
    #   participant :ref => 'jig_advanced', # will PUT the the string returned by
    #     :host   => 'anotherhost',         # workitem.fields['foo_bar'].to_s to
    #     :path   => '/path/to/bar',        # http://anotherhost:80/path/to/bar,
    #     :method => :put                   # processes the response body and
    #                                       # saves the result in the workitem
    #                                       # field 'incoming_foo_bar'

      #
      # ==options hash
      # :host <String>:: The host to connect to (defaults to 127.0.0.1)
      # :port <Fixnum>:: ...and its port (defaults to 3000)
      # :path <String>:: The path part of the URL. Defaults to '/'.
      # :method <Symbol>:: Which HTTP method shall be used? One of :get, :post, :put and :delete.
      # :options_for_jig <Hash>:: Hash of options which will be passed to Rufus::Jig::Http.new.
      # :options_for_jig_requests <Hash>:: Hash of options which will be passed to the get, put, post or delete method of Rufus::Jig::Http
      # :response_handling <Proc>:: An optional Proc which handles the results Rufus::Jig::Http returns. Takes the results and the workitem as arguments. By default (when no Proc is given), the server's response is stored in the workitem field \_\_jig_response__ and the HTTP status code in \_\_jig_status__.
      # :data_preparition <Proc>:: An optional Proc which prepares the data being sent with POST or PUT requests. Takes the workitem as argument. Should return a string or another type Rufus::Jig::Http can handle. By default (if no Proc is given), the workitem will be converted into a Hash (and then into a JSON string by rufus-jig).
      # :content_type <String or Symbol>:: The content type to use for the HTTP request. Defaults to :json. Other types has to be submitted as strings. Note that you really should provide a :data_preparition-Proc if you don't use JSON!
